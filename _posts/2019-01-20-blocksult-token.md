# Blocksult Telegram Channel and the Blocks token

It's a lazy Sunday afternoon, so no long posts today, but rather an invitation to our Telegram channel:

https://t.me/blocksult

This telegram channel is dedicated to crypto related news and topics.

Here, you will also find news and information about our latest meetups, events, webinars, researches and so on.

I will be collecting the best crypto related questions and publishing the answers, here, in the channel, once every week.

As I like to experiment with crypto, I will be handing out my own token to all the telegram users with a BTS account, who wish to receive it. Later on, users will be able to use that token to partially pay for service that we provide. For example: webinars, courses, consultations etc.

I will be publishing more information about the token and its distribution as the channel grows.
