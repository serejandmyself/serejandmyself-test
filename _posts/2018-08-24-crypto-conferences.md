# The "beuty" of crypto-conferences

Day, after day, I am getting the shock of watching crypto events unfold. They organizators keep on valuing their events, judging by the amount of visitors or \ and by the profits the make (some even go as far as judging by the amount of likes on facebook).

There is only one valuation for your event guys: content, content and content once more. The amount of pseudo “experts” and government officials is NOT a success indicator by any means. Success is when:

It is being talked about
It is recommended for others to visit
Real experts of the industry (you can spot these “rare fish” by a working project they made) write to you and ask to be a speaker by themselves

Content is not “ico”, its not marketing, it's not regulation… its development, its research, its trends, its “picking” the industry from the inside.

Oh. A a bit more: most of the really cool crypto events don't just pass on “silently”. There is no mass media there, there is no ico’s and so on… there is a different format for those (I am currently writing a concept paper for these and will put it into open access as soon as its finished).

Ashame I can't tag here those who really do make cool events. But there are those who do! And i'm glad they exist.
