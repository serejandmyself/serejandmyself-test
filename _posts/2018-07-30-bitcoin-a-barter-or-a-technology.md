# Bitcoin: a barter technology or a means of communication?

A lot of people ask themselves the question of whether bitcoin is nothing but a return to the essence of money exchange between human beings. In other words, is bitcoin not more than just a return to “barter economics”?

Well, no, no and once again no. Bitcoin by all means, cannot represent barter economics. It simply has much more qualities than what can be classified as a means of barter. 

Ask yourself this. What is money? Money is a means of communication (let's not dig the rabbit hole too deep, but yeah, “transactional interrelationships” come to mind). It's been a while since we have proven that barter can only work on a scale “not greater than”. Just get yourself familiar with what is [Dunbar’s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number).

Thanks (to the one who needs to be thanked for it) for inventing money as we know it (first came leaves or seashells, it doesn't matter really…), and then it begun developing. First into something more abstract and eventually we came to where we are today. Money as a mathematically proven protocol. Money as a means of communication.

Here is one more question. If money is a means of communication, then what should all those who don't have it do?

Well, (thanks Andreas once again) in other words: “Lets not bank the unbanked, but d-bank the banked"
