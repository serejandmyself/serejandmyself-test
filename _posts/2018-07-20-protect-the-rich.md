# Protect the rich

My "Facshiste" feed (and same goes for more and more everyday talks that I hear) is recently full of c***y posts about the need to protect ICO investors; about the need to introduce laws in order to protect the investors and so on...

[Eleanor Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Roosevelt) had once said:
>"Freedom makes a huge requirement of every human being. With freedom comes responsibility. For the person who is unwilling to grow up, the person who does not want to carry his own weight, this is a frightening prospect."

In short (because most won't even care to read the source), "With great freedom, comes great responsibility..."

The blockchain is about: open protocols (and only open), not closed. It means decentralization, it means freedom, it means openness, it means crossing out despots and regimes.

And this in turn means - responsibility. Responsibility for your own decisions and for what one does. Investing in a scam project (not to be able to simply read or analyze a project in this sphere), and then try to go as far-fetched as possible, try bringing all the "dirty" and the disgusting bulls**t that you call "the law" (and I call "propaganda"), is just silly...

(If you are easily offended please do not comment. Especially something along the lines of "But what about the children...")
