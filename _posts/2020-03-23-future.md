> Every time you stay outside the apartment, you must always keep a distance of 1.5 meters from other people. More than two people should no longer stand together

## TL;DR

The vision of how the world will look after the end of corona hasn't been promising at all. While most people are busy taking care of themselves
and their loved once, governments and politicians do what they do best, inflict strict privacy and control measures whenever possible.

Now, by no means, I am saying that the COVID issue isn't real. It is. And it is defiantly exaggerated by many people too. This also doesn't mean you shouldn't act. If you are unfamiliar with what to do to keep yourself safe during the virus, I suggest to check out any of the endless recommendations on the internet from your trusted sources. 

But that's not the point. The point is that borders easily close, but alas, open with difficulty. Last time we have seen such an intervention into human privacy was post-WW-I (main primarily intervention into privacy and business by the government) and WW-II.  Most of the then introduced measures where periodical measures to help. But, as we all know, they stayed. The question is what measures will stick with us this time?

## Avoiding the (un)happened

I promised not to post pictures in my blog and I won't. Therefore, below, you may find a bunch of links to the possible evolution of our society take on privacy... I have tried to gather 10 interesting links that will showcase the point, I'm, trying to make. The idea is not to raise panic or call for actions. All that I wish for, is for everyone to see and decide for themselves, what if any,
can be the consequences. 

## The Inglorious bastards

1) One of Norway's cities to implement a surveillance system:

- Continuously monitors people's location via phone outgoing data. If too many are located within a defined area, you get an SMS telling you to disperse
- Do you think this system could monitor you A.C. (after corona)?

## Anti statements suck, what have we learnt:

Yes, they do. But as a society, we haven't learned much from the last time this happened. And we will not learn much this time around. The irony is that most nations behave pretty much the same way they behaved before the last major world conflict.

While we keep on trusting centralized structures, nothing will change. Ever. Make a decision. Think.

This is only the beginning. We have a major recession coming after the end of the virus. Small businesses. Unbacked loans. Not enough FIAT money in the economy. Overdue visas. You name it. We will have it. 

- Politicians oppose socialism (and rightfully so) to protect their finances first hand. **Governance should be versatile**
- Banks print money. A lot of money. The brrrr strategy keeps on regardless of the outcome. **Monetary policies should be decentralized**
- Working remotely has always been known to be a better solution. **Jobs should be created by the market and be flexible and open to anyone**
- The global economy is fragile as a paper dollar. **The old economic system is dead. Completly dead**
- Countries behave selfishly and don't care about integrity **Borders are an instrument of control**
