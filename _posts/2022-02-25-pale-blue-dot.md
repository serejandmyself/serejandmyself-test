> Stars are not for humans - Arthur C. Clarke

## TL;DR and nothing else matters
I wonder just how much does it take humanity to start understanding that the issue is not a leader, not a country, not a flag and not the nationality of your neighbor, and its not even the people that have more of something that you don't.

The issue is the freaking system, the people who enslave you, build borders, give you weapons, steal your money via taxation (well, you may think of it as the mafia - ya want protection - ya gotta pay pal), and lead you to believe that you have another enemy, but themselves. 

The latest conflict shows the complete lack of this understanding in people. Its a very sad time to be a human. If I could have a choice, I would rather be a rock. Sigh

"Stars are not for humans..."
