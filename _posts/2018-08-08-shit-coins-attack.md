# Shit coins attack or follow the price

I am in the midst of writing an article about the future development of the blockchain technology (of course from a very subjective point of view). Will share it soon, I hope.

Meanwhile, I would like to address a small question: "Is it ok, that altcoins keep on multiplying like crazy?"

Yes. It is. Each sh...altcoin has its own value for its own set of users. Each currency has its own features and its own "magic" to its followers.

There are a bunch of principles that sit down deep inside of us as humans. Some of these are: the longing for freedom and independence of anything or anyone and the natural wish to create "tokens". Yes... to create tokens.

Starting from a small age we "trade" with each other. We trade leaves, we trade shells, we trade paper... And it really doesn't matter whether this is the consequence of social development or whether this is an evolutionary process. It is here. It exists.

The creation of a "backstreet boys" coin (or the NUFC coin - that's not as scary I hope), sounds like a horrible dream come true. But this will certainly have more value, than lets say, the CAR Frank.
