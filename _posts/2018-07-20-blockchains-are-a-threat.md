# Is blockchain a threat?

Are blockchain enthusiasts a threat to the current establishment?

Well, to understand that, one needs to grasp, that it is ideas that change the world.

Sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worst. But they change it. The blockchain is an idea based on mathematics, with a simple, to implement, algorithm.

But it's not just about numbers! What makes it stronger is that it has people behind it, people that made a free choice.

Does this make it dangerous? Maybe...
Do we question the authorities? No, we do not.

The blockchain is not about politics. No.
It is about moral ethics. It is about freedom. About freedom of choice.

Are we a threat?
No. The blockchain does not use propaganda as opposed to the establishment. It uses education. It uses freedom of choice. It is about value, not about threats.

The blockchain is a path (not the solution) to a fairer world. A path to a better and a cheaper transaction between humans beings.

So maybe, it is the time for the establishment to use the blockchain as a reflexion for certain things?
