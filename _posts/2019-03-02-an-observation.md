# An interesting observation…

In countries where people show real interest towards blockchain as a technology, most of the meetups / small conferences are (1) free (99.99+%) (2) marketing \ there is no discussions about pr talks (not that there is no room for it, its just not about it) (3) there is no information about those events on FB \ Instagram \ Telegram etc…

The observation is based on roughly 5-6 countries...
