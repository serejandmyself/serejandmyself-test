# A public Watch List

I have been working on a public watch list that includes my own view on what projects should one watch and for what reasons.

The list is currently saved on a google spreadsheet and the link is available at the following GitHub repository:

https://github.com/serejandmyself/Public-Watch-List

I urge you to read the Introduction section and the legend section, PRIOR, to reading the list.

The list itself contains almost 150 assets, technologies, games etc. All are open source projects, with links and explanations.

The explanations are partially self-explanatory. But bear in mind that to understand it fully, you will need to have some grasp of blockchain technology and read the project's documentation.

The full explanation is provided in the “introduction” section to the list.
