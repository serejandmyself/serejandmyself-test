# Privacy Basics

I've started to collect privacy-oriented links into a public repo.

I will be grateful for any open-source links you might have to do with privacy. This can be:
Applications, operational systems, extensions, browsers, cryptocurrencies (here be careful please, as my filter is a bit harsh) and so on.

I will also be grateful if anyone wishes to share their ideas / pointers / rules and so on, on keeping privacy - private. This can be anything to do with the use of computers, mobile phones, the internet and so on.

You can write to me on telegram or in the GitHub repo.

There, you can also see what has been added already: https://github.com/serejandmyself/Privacy-Basics
