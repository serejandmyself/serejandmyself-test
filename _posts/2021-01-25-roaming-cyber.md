## TL;DR
As of January 2021 I have made the decision to leave the cyber\~Congress DAO. I would like to point out that I am not leaving Cyber as a project. In fact, I am transforming my work at Cyber as the DAO's ecosystem developer, into a more productive role of an adviser / a freelance artist... Whatever, you want to call it.

I want to thank my colleagues at the [DAO](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress) for the opportunity to work on such a crazy, phenomenal and an exciting project as Cyber. Guys... trust me, Cyber will go down into the history as the foundation of the Great Web.

## Why have I left and the consequences
Well... let's be frank. I haven't left Cyber. In fact #citizencosmos is still one of the top heroes (validators) on the project, and I am planing to work closely with the future foundation and with the current DAO. We have some internal agreements in hand and I will still be committing to the repos.

I have my own vision for the idea, and I am planning to develop it further, beyond the Congress. I truly believe that the forming of such decentralized clusters is something the projects can only benefit from. A good house is always more than just one brick. What I am trying to say, is that to my knowledge, and knowing the plans, Cyber will only benefit from such a decision.

I had amazing time at the Congress and 2 of my best friends are at its foundation. I am grateful to continue working with them and carry the these values to the rest of the universe.

## What's next?
The world is our oyster. Currently, I am heavily focused on [Citizen Cosmos](https://www.citizencosmos.space/). Lately, we have been a little quite (well... depends how you look at it), due to some personal matters. But we are growing day by day, both, as a podcast and as a validator (and our plans go much further beyond simply securing the networks that we do, as one can notice with Cyber and Cosmos).

My vision for CC is somewhat abstract, but we have plenty of things planned out for every aspect of the project. Blockchains have changed the world. I have spent over 5.5 years working for dentalized projects and if it has taught me anything - is to keep on learning.

Sincerely: #fuckgoogle
