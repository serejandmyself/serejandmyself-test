**The 100 words explanation:** <br>

Ox is an open-source protocol that enables direct P2P exchange (the OTC protocol) of assets on ETH, and a standard for decentralized exchanges (referred to as - relayers, third party liquidity providers) on ETH. The 0x mission is to create and provide tools for the emerging blockchain tokenization of assets. 0x supports the development of public blockchain protocols, in order to build a more efficient financial system. The token can be used for fees and for taking part in the decentralized governance of the protocol. 0x will probably be working closely with the likes of Polkadot (bridging between blockchains, including to ERC20 standard).
