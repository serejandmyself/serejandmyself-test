# How many nodes will there be in 50 years time?

On this day, 115 years ago, there was only one aircraft in the sky.

According to flighradar, today, on average - there are 15,000 per day.

According to Wikipedia - just 20 years ago, per every 100 habitats of the planet, only 3 were internet users.

Today, that number stands, roughly, at 50 (and that's including the crazy amount of population added).

I wonder, how many nodes will there be live in 50 years from now across the globe (of any algorithm \ consesnsus)?
