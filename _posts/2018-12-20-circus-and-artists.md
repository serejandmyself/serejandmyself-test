# Artists change, but the circus is here to stay

Just saw a friend post on FB, that it was once popular to wear ICO t-shirts, and now it is popular to wear t-shirts with names of exchanges on them.

Alas… but that describes the issue exactly: The artists change, but the circus is here to stay!

People never used their heads to think, and they won’t.

Just as people shed tears, because they get their head deep into markets that they don't understand anything about, so they will.

And here is my small prediction - cycle behaviorism is here to stay. And if the last “drive” (to be read in brackets only) of the pseudo-market was ICO, the next one, will be exchanges. And I’m not talking only about “bAinaNAs” and so on. I'm also talking about SIX, ICE, CBOE, MasterCard (if you get it, then you do…) and the rest.

I am sure, that they will play a major role in the next “drive” (it's not happening soon yet, don't worry) and in its end too, for the “mass market”.
