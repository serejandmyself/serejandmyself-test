# Whining post this is... sad sad me is...

I guess this is a bit "up the arse" mode from me, but I really couldn't care less.

It gets me sick reading messages / news / post updates from people who reckon they "know" blockchain.

1) If you are doing private blockchain - I don't care, don't write to me / unfriend me / unfollow me
2) If you are doing an ICO (in its basic formalism) - I probably don't care, don't write to me / unfriend me / unfollow me
3) If you are working with blockchain and haven't used the tech yourself (mined, wrote a SM etc) - I don't care, don't write to me /  unfriend me / unfollow me
4) If you doing: banking, insurance, e-commerce, payment gateways - I don't care, don't write to me / unfriend me / unfollow me
5) If you judge blockchain by: price, media news etc - I don't care, eff off 
6) If you haven't read at least 20 WP, and are spending less than 30 hours per week on research and "doing" blockchain - guess what? Eff off
7) If you have less than 60% developers on your team, or visiting blockchain conferences (other then dev conferences) - I don't care, don't write to me / unfriend me / unfollow me

I do care, if:
1) You are open-source
2) You have a product
3) You at least care to know what things like - DLT, UTXO, hashrate, cuckoo cycle, tensority mean... (no advertisement intended, just random words, that popped into the mind upon first though)
4) You probably are a developer, or have at least twice as many developers on your team, as other positions
5) You have a "working" GitHub account
6) You DON'T think that blockchain relates to finance
7) You know how, for example, holochain, aeternity, zilliqa are different from others (please don't bother to ask)

If this offends you - read the above again =)

Ohâ€¦ this doesn't mean we don't do education. We do - I do. But there is a difference between educating people and interacting with people who pretend they are what they are not.
