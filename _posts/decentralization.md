Today is a strange day. Both, sad and joyfull simultenously. Today decentralization has (nearly) died...

An openeing key note to this post: I couldnt care less about beraucratic policies, however I do not want my collegues answering
for my wrods. This post reflects my perosnal views and might not be in line with what other team memebrs of cyber\~Congress think think...

TL;DR
A few weeks ago our team at cyber\~Congress submitted a governance proposal to the Cosmos hub, proposign it to use 10k ATOM from
the community pool for an excanhge of CYB tokens via a future IBC connection. In other words, an offer to make a colelctive decisin on 
participating i Cybers takeoff round.

What was cool about this is that it is the first ever DeVCcase in history (knowm to me). Rather then using the old centrlized instruments,
we have used the new decentrzlies onchain governance mechainsim (alas, this is why we all here) to secure an anchor donation from a related community pool.

Why is it realted? Cyber is a Cosmso-SDK, Tendermitn-based chain that has been building for the past 2+ years on that stack. But, this is irelevant for my story.

What did we ry to achieve and what happened?
We tried to propose to test 2 things (a) decentrlzization, (b) economic realtions between Tendermint blockchains, (c) utlitze a 
decentrlied onchian instrument as a marketing isntrument (the latter was a huge success).

To save you a long story short, the proposal was rejected and I would liek to talk about the why's and of my personal feedabck on these why's.

The good, the bad and the ugly
Before me move forward, let me jsut say, that there was tremendous support for the proposal form various people, validators and onlookers.
In fact, there were far more yes votes than abstain, no or no with veto. But its the weight of the votes that counts, and certain 
validator votes outweighted the yes, which largely came from delegators (although 20 validators votes voted yes, which is more than the amount of validators that voted no)
An interesting observation I noticed, that a lot of the info published on Comsos channels after that didnt provide this breakdown to the onlookers, saying that it was rejected with such and such numbrs. I think this is 
largley worng. Everyone shold know the exact numbers. Of ocurse, one might say, look in the explorer. Well, as someone wwith over 5 years of public blcockahin proejcts,
it does NOT work this way. user largeyl overlook these and its better to be fully transparent when providing such numbers.

We got plenty of attention to the project and got to find out about a lot of supporters, which is by far the best thing. I have spent 2 
weeks workign, primarily on this, and have somewhat a biased and a peronified opinion of cousre, alas, its justified me thinks...

Fear, beraucracy and decentralization
We know come to the juciy part. Do I want to share this and be viewed as an upset puppy that got punished for peeing on the floor? No. But I have the courage to speak
up my mind and to say what I think. Is this bad feeback? On the contrary! Its good. Deventrlziion nearly dies, but stil has hopes. We jsut need to make it happen. All of us as a collective mind.

Did we do evertyhing correct? No. 100% no. Could we have done this better? Yes. 100% yes. But lets break down the feedback:

1) You didnt submit your proposal on time, there was no offchain discussion prior to voting
2) The community pool is not an investemnt fund. Probably the woerders feedback. Who decides whats the community pool for? The 
communty as far as im ocncerend. Most voted yes. So most think that it is suaitabe. People are led to believe that governance is for making decisons to do with electing soemthing, someone, somwehre. BS. Governance is aobout 
collective deciosns on politcs, economics, investing, protocol updates, etc. Teh commutny pool is there to beocem sutainable. It cant inflate itself for ever. The foudnation will only support it for as long as it has fiat money. It will finish.
3) You project is not suitable to recieve the funding. I have to be onest. There was very little of feedabck like this. In fact this came maybe from 4 or 5 poeple. Mainyl stating that its not a Cosmos related project, which it is of course. And those stating that we should have phrased our words differntly to outline our work around COmsos. Wierd feedback. Firstly, we did outline it. Secondly, we shouldt outline it. Its a question of making a decison to get profit from an asset. Not a grant.
4) You should have aplied for a grant from the legal foundation. Firstly, lets be transparent. As a person I have recieved one grant from the foudnation and
even applied for another one. This has nothign to do with Cyber. This is to do with projects revolving directly around Comsos and grants there are for work promised to be done or done already for Cosmos. Its suitable. What we did here, was not ask for a grant. It shoudl be fixed in peopels minds.




post: beraucracy, cowardness, decentalziton, to much boundaries, controlling the market, grants are a very different way of achieving things,
