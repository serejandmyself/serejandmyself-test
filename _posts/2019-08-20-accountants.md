# Accountants and ledgers

Sometimes, it is the small things in life that make you happy - the eyes don't twitch and the hands don't shake (then again - the latter are probably the results of a hyper-active childhood, but not to worry - all the rest is in place).

And it might look like its nothing really. But, let's just say its to carry on my latest topic of “what to read in crypto”, and about the good, the bad and the ugly projects out there.

And here is a beautiful example of open and auditable accounting in crypto-projects.

But first, a bit of a lyrical sidetracking: the project is slightly on the “dark side”. I put it on my watch-list, but to be honest I'm not sure what is the great point behind another anonymous coin on a high-end competitive market.

The heck with it, of course… what was I talking about? Ah yes! Accountants and ledgers.

All magic aside, here is the link:

Please note the cool VERIFY button beside it. A good old A* just for that.

And a good grade to the founder for this: https://sourcerer.io/krypt0x
, good lad to say the least.

And the point of all this? Well, if you use good practices, then you might actually get somewhere (that is, of course, if you have a product, to begin with).

That's it for today folks - peace out.
