# Julian Assange

It's upsetting that most “cryponoaunts” didn't even notice the arrest of Assange.

Meanwhile, it is nothing but a bold statement that says: “you will play by the rules that were written for you”.

Assange’s arrest means saying “Guilty” to all the war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan (and other countries). His arrest means saying “Guilty” to all the other crimes described on Wikileaks. His arrest shows you how easy governments are bought today. Assange's arrest is the violation of basic human rights his arrest is the war against crypto. Assange's arrest is the war against every free human being out there.
