# The anarchy of freedom

The below outlines a view on the aspects of modern human protocol, their inability to function correctly and a vision on what can replace it. It is written in free-form flow, somewhat resembling the likes of an unveiling chain of events; hence, it is meant to be read from beginning to end, without sipping “blocks”. 

But first hand a short introduction with regards to why “anarchy of freedom”. This article is meant to point out out that we are, in fact, existing in a type of modern-slavery with a forced social formalism. I have not found a better way to describe the true aspect of freedom, but with the word “anarchy”, implying that it is actually the only way to abolish hierarchy in decision making and free choice of governance, money and other important virtues.    

Bitcoin is money and money is a communication protocol, with the help of which all aspects of our lives evolve. We speak money. Its is a measure of freedom, you cannot censor, or - enforce communicatio. As opposed to that this is exactly what fiat money does. It offers you to silently accept the fact that you cannot choose to speak your mother tongue. You are forced to communicate via the words and signals of others.

But why a communication protocol? The only way for mammals to survive in the food chain was and remains via communicating. Via exchanging signals that in turn make us who we are. It is a type of an in-depth sociological level of consensus, but one that can take many formalisms - free and unbiased.   Humans heavily undervalue communication, leaving social engineering to drive us to vanity, selfishness, boxed up innovation in the only required realm, and hence sociology evolves unnaturally. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that it cuts almost all possible branches and versioning at the very tip, before they begin to take shape.

We require our brain, but it has long been proven that we are social creatures. Therefore, we must use communication for survival, from hunting to online packet routing. We are still worthless without signals and the information exchange, that has become the new type of signals. We are actually capable of switch our brain off and survive. Look at people in comas. but they are unable to communicate, which causes society to cross them out of its version.

So, yes - money is a protocol for exchanging signals of trade, of interest, of power, of fear, of anything really. From a very simple - when you see it you know what to expect \ to do, etc. And up to the more complicated "it's what makes the world spin round". 

Central banks are scams. Fiat money  is a scam. Financial systems are a scam. A never ending formula of debt, in which  95% of money in circulation is fictional - non-existent. With the only real value in that loop - are the asset the lender promises to repay, but are in fact given as collateral to the system in exchange for fake equity, that is... debt. 

A scam of absolute totalitarian regimes in which people aren't able to choose who to trade with freely, how to live, and as a result of that and - where to live. People are forced to support the laws that support those who do speak out loud. Those who are in control of the financial regimes, in which you have absolutely no right of say.

The only right that one has, is to elect someone who will in fact become one with that system if it is forced upon people. In fact, “a one” is forced to believe that he has a right to a free vote. One has also the right to pay a fee, on what he is led to believe as his own best cause, but in reality, he has no choice in those decisions.

Those who do speak the forced language are meant to find a way for all others to communicate the same tongue. But instead they act as rulers. They are not rulers - they are chosen servants. A chosen to serve must not be “single”, it doesn't work that way. A centralised forced communication protocol does not (and physically cannot) include all the languages and does not respect all the rules, for everyone on the same level. One person cannot, even if he wished to, understand everyone else.

The only possible way to solve that is to allow free choice when it comes to deciding who we wish to speak to, and who we do not. In turn, this leads to the creation of private and competitive mediums of exchange and stores of value. One we can give to those who wish to accept it as the above. And by that, we create free markets and elementary borders as they will not make any sense in a place where markets range from 2 up to infinity. Where inside each market above 2, there are possibly more internal markets. This allows a collective and a willing creation of internet communication protocols between money. Ad if build on decentralised systems, the need for surveillance is eliminated. No need for a range of ruling entities:  banks and controlling monetary agents. By using the above as a digital, rather than as "hard-real" money, we eliminate the need for indeed “offices and structures”. We elemmenta one of the things that passes the most physical disease  and sponsors the biggest dark economic sector, both good and bad parts of it (but the good parts will always easily recreate itself in a free market).

We eliminate fiat-paper money, of course. By using a digital token, we achieve true portability qualities, true divisibility, true indestructibility, and a higher level of security.

By using a decentralized consensus, or by using a way of coming to an agreement which might not even require for the mass to choose a “correct” answer. Democracy Is a scam. Like any formalism created in order to push choice. One can, for example, simply be sure that the information / goods / money / which were written in any foreign language, make sure that what is accepted, is only done so in a way understandable to him. Which he choose freely and it is his understanding of the accepted information that is important - it's a free choice. 

This is easily achieved by using the money protocol as both - as a distributed ledger of any formalism, where protects are able to show all previous versions of data, in a safe and a distributed manner, and that have willingly accepted consensus mechanism. Digital communication makes sure this is achieved. Making it decentralised, makes sure it is not forced upon, as simply an agreement of any consensus. Both parts are vital to this vision. 
This allows for communicating rules that aren't fixed to the ground by nails. They have the ability to be viewed and reviewed and agreed upon, by the free markets that wish to communicate between one another. Those communications might not even include value in terms of goods or money as a means to buy something. They can include many other discernible or scarce value - reputation or a collectable, art included. Hence, each market chooses its own laws applicable to the situation values, that are accepted by all involved sides. This is decentralised law. This eliminates the need for forced fees - taxes are now a free will and any community and private funding or equity as such, are spent as wished by the involved sides, as per agreed within that market. They speak the same language as the others that are involved in the communication process, and they are now used for the use of what is willingly chosen.

Ruling, as a term of totalitarian regimes, completely closed organizations and formalisms - ends. It loses competitive value it the free market, where it has no forced customers, that do not wish to communicate with it. And it has no “hidden” help from scammy centralised law systems.

Corporations that are forcing their own goods, that are sold to us on terms that we cannot have a say in, that are sold to us in a monopolized market, in an environment where they can be supported or worse, offer scam support to centelaies rulers, will not get any customers. The customers will flee to open markets for all the above mentioned reasons. Local organizations emerge within the space of a free market, maybe not even having a physical location - no borders. A fairer and clearer formalisms.

Privacy is a choice. It is a fundamental right in every aspect to communication protocols and hence to money, to law and to identity. If you wish not to speak, but you wish to write. If you wish not to vote, if you wish to pay for something and remain anonymous. If you follow the local protocols by free choice, you are as free as you ought to be, to do so anonymously. But along with proof of not being scam or align with a prove to be able to buy something, or to actually say something if you needed to, but couldn't so right now. It is easily achieved by using privacy-inbuilt digitally distributed ledgers.

The abolition of scams and centralised systems that force upon their language, their alphabet, their ways of communication and their fake data. The abolition of ruling systems as opposed to those, created to serve and free of forced fees systems.

The abolition of systems that are forcing their law, money, rules, decision making and total surveillance mechanisms, education programming, taxes, welfare and voting models, and social behavior that arises from forced upon masks that you need in order to live with the above.
 
However, it is you who wish to accept what the matrix feeds you. The abolition of  the corrupted, rotten, controlling, bound to fail and already falling systems. Abolition of those will pave way to a decentralised, distributed, freely chosen formalism for each individual, that chooses to accept the information he receives and communicate freely on his own terms.

In turn, this takes shape into a free and willingly created or accepted matrix around us. A much more accepted reality free of physical, illogical, digital or any other boundaries. This will open the possibilities to evolve as beings and for whatever other thinking organism or mechanical architectures we might create, or create by the created. 

A future that sees innovation, competitiveness, shares visions and goals, in which people understand their reason. Fulfill their needs. Give freely. Openly speak, and belong to - by free choice. A world in which exploration for new and for the beyond has a purpose. A world in which there is a place for bigger things than simple value based upon greed. Seeking for inter galactic and beyond communication protocols, with the wish to evolve and to be free.
